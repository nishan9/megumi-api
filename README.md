## Additional Gems  üíé

### Security Brakeman üîë

[Brakeman](https://brakemanscanner.org/) is a vulnerability scanner for Ruby on Rails applications.

#### How to Run Brakeman

```bash
brakeman
```

#### Generate a report

```bash
brakeman -f html > ~/report.html
open ~/report.html
```

### Rubocop

[Rubocop](https://rubocop.org/) is a Ruby static code analyzer and formatter.

## Continuous integration üßë‚Äçüîß

A GitHub Action has been created to run unit tests on every pull request against the `main` branch and `main` itself.

Added database timeouts for the production PostgreSQL database to resolve long-running queries. Look for `config/database.yml`.

## Deployment üßë‚Äçüîß

How to deploy the application

```bash
docker build -t megumi .
docker volume create app-storage
docker run --rm -it -v app-storage:/rails/storage -p 3000:3000 --env RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<see config/master.key> megumi
```

Note: Ensure cors in configured properly on the application to allow traffic and the VM needs to have the required ports opened. 

## Potential improvements ü§Ø

- [PgHero](https://github.com/ankane/pghero): PgHero can help identify issues in PostgreSQL.
- [Rollbar](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-gem): Rollbar is a tool for error reporting.
- [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq): Sidekiq is a tool for handling background jobs in Ruby.

- export_event feature needs to be tested properly which can be achieved with [AWS Client Stub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/ClientStubs.html)
- The AWS credentials needs to be made into an ENV variable 
- Move the export feature to a more reusable component
- filter_by_params can be made into a reusable component
- Pagination endpoint needs to return appropriate headers such as next-page, prev-page etc.
- There can be different validation logic for metadata for different events 
- Filtering can be expanded to support more filter attributes
- Validation for Device UUID can be further expanded to look up in a potential device table
- Categories can be expanded into a more configuration list as opposed to how it is hard coded now
- There needs to be some authentication/authorisation can be accomplished via a authentication provide such as Auth0 or Devise. 
- Sending appropriate HTTP headers depending on the use case
- Fixtures or factorybot can be utilised in testing to reduce repetition
- The database can be seeded with many different types of events which can be used to run tests against
-
